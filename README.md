# Morse-Decoder
This repo is a university project completed by myself, Luke Price and Bradley Seagar. We used AVR Assembly Language in order to control an Arduinio microcontroller, taking a series of inputs through button presses, and converting the pattern of inputs into a letter to appear on a 7 segment display.
